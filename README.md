<!-- --Big 'O' Notation-- -->

How long an algorithm takes to run.

1. Pinning the exact runtime of an algorithm has many edge cases.
   ex. speed of processor, background processes etc.

2. We measure the SIZE of our input which we call 'n'. (O(n))

3. asymptote - "big O analysis" || "asymptomatic analysis"

4. In a situation were you have nested loops.
   If our array has 'n' items, our outer loop runs 'n' times and our inner loop runs 'n' times for each iteration of the outer loop. Meaning this function runs in "O(n2)" || "quadratic time"

--Take Away--
A good engineer knows how to strike the right balance between space, implementation time, maintainability, and readability.

<!-- --Random Access Memory--(RAM) -->

1. When code is executed our variables, numbers, strings, arrays, etc. are stored in 'RAM'

2. Ram has slots that are numbered. We refer to these slots as addresses.

3. Each slot holds 8bits which equal '1 byte'.
   These bits are made of 1's and 0's
